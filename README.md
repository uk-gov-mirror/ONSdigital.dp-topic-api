# dp-topic-api

Enables greater flexibility in creating journeys through the website

## Getting started

* Run `make debug`

### Dependencies

To run the Topic API locally requires the following:

* Mongo db (you can use [dp-compose](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose) to stand up an instance in a local Docker container)
* Once you have a working mongo db instance, you will want to populate your database with topics - see `./scripts/README.md` for seeding scripts
* No further dependencies other than those defined in `go.mod`. However, although by default the Topic API has the ENABLE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS environment variable set to false, note that it is commonly set to true locally (in the .zshrc - for use in the dp-compose stacks) so it may need to be explicitly set to false:

```shell
export ENABLE_PRIVATE_ENDPOINTS=false
```

Otherwise, AWS Cognito authorisation will be needed, e.g. run [the auth stack in dp-compose](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-compose/tree/main/v2/stacks/auth#auth-stack) and then log into your local Florence using your sandbox Florence credentials.

### Tools

To run some of our tests you will need additional tooling:

#### Audit

We use `dis-vulncheck` to do auditing, which you will [need to install](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dis-vulncheck).

#### Linting

We use v2 of golangci-lint, which you will [need to install](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/welcome/install).

#### Validating Specification

To run `make validate-specification`, which can be used to validate the swagger spec, you require Node v20.x and to install @redocly/cli:

```shell
npm install -g @redocly/cli
```
